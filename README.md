# AR-Leechbug-CardGame
 My first exploration into AR development. Players use cards to spawn fish (from Leechbug) to fight each other autonomously using my AI tech from Leechbug.

Will update this README in the future with more details on current tasks and future goals. 

Also please forgive the terrible file structure for now. Copied over a lot of resources from another project and still need to sort it all out.
